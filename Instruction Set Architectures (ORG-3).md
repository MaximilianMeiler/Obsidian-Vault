What is an ISA?
- Defines instruction formats (structure, instruction fields)
- Defines how memory is organized (registers, bytes)
	- Registers: fast cpu memory
	- Cache: middle ground (not defined by ISA)
- Defines how memory is addressed (relative/physical address)
- Defines how exceptions are handled (interrupts, exceptions)
