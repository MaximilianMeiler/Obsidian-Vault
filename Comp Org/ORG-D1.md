**Computer** - A machine that computes
- Given an input, will produce another output
- Combines a processing & memory unit
	- Processing is made of a control unit & ALU

Processing terms
- **Chip** - Hardware that contains the CPU
	- **CPU** - Executes instructions and processes data
		- **Core** - Individual processing unit on a CPU
			- **ALU** - Performs arithmetic and logic operations
			- **Control unit** - manages data flow
	- Each chip contains circuits made up of logic gates and transistors
		- Transistors can be swapped on and off easily
- Memory
	- Stored in an array of cells - several bits per memory address
	- Stored in binary (0s and 1s), 8 bits in a byte
