Benchmarking
- Used to compare two computers!
- Relative performance: Time0 / Time1
- Done with SPEC programs
	- Base and Peak ratios calculated between run programs between computers
	- Compute routines: Matrix routines, memory access, etc
	- Performance of each program: Geometric mean of overall stat
		- Multiply n terms together, take nth root
