Benchmarking
- Used to compare two computers!
- Relative performance: Time0 / Time1
- Done with SPEC programs
	- Base and Peak ratios calculated between run programs between computers
		- 1450: computer is 1450x faster than base model (not stronger?)
		- Base: on average, it is that much faster than the base machine
	- Clock rate is located next to the name in GHz
	- Compute routines: Matrix routines, memory access, etc
	- Performance of each program: Geometric mean of overall stat
		- Multiply n terms together, take nth root
