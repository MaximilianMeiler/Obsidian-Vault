### Notes for writing the FA paper	

Goal
- Discuss what happened
- Discuss why the failure matters
	- Consequences
	- Lessons/progression
- How was info on the failure gathered?
- What solutions are now presented?

Sourcing
- Min 6 sources, should have min 12
- 2 visuals, 1 of which you make
	- Tables/graphs u can make

Intro
- Context
	- Define key terms, give reader some basic knowledge
- Conflict statement - a thesis about what didn't happen as planned
- Consequences of the failure
- Failure event details
- Graphic of failure

Analysis
- Cover what happened, why it matters, how you know, and what happens next
- Two important steps
	- Define a test - extended definition (what, how, what data is gathered)
	- Describe their outcomes
- Organizational patterns
	- Test classes -> specific tests
	- In a broader case, organize first by types of failure

Conclusion
- Statement of root causes of failure
- Recommendations
- Shouldn't be similar to anything that was previously in the paper
	- Intro should just introduce the key terms, not test outcomes
		- Conclusion should be much more high-level
