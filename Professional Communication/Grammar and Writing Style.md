Be clear, concise, precise
## Grammar 1

Passive vs. active voice
- Active: `subject, verb, object`
- ANY variation is passive
	- Passive is generally wordier and less clear

Split infinitive
- Infinitive: "to" + verb
- Splitting: placing a verb in between "to" and the verb
	- Avoid this!

Dangling modifier
- Modification clause is thrown to the end of the sentence, causing several possible interpretations in terms of subject/very application
- Solutions: move the subject and modifier together
- "Don't let worry kill you, let the church help"

Informality
- Jargon: Diction that sounds out-of-place outside of intended setting
- Doublespeak: Wordier replacements for simple words
- ClichÃ©: Language so overused it no longer means anything

Wordiness
- Redundancies
- Repetitive wording
- Unnecessary clauses - "Due to the fact that"

GRADING OF RESEARCH REPORT
- Thorough analysis required
	- Find trends, interpret them
- Thorough data collection & methodology
- Organize the paper properly
	- Discussion - present tense
	- Methodology - past tense
- Appropriate grammar and writing style
- Neutral & unbiased tone

Use passive voice to avoid pronouns in HARD sciences, but not in SOFT sciences
- Decide on personal pronoun use, stay consistent
- If using personal pronouns, avoid passive voice entirely
	- Can use "we" == "the researchers". Nothing else.
	- Complexify sentence structure to take impact off of the pronouns
- If using passive voice, try to edit verbs/subject to avoid it wherever possible

Around a dozen sources in intro. Discussion writer uses these.
Source buckets
- Background info (non-academic, just factual)
	- Current situation
- Significance of the problem (academic)
	- What is the measurable impact of the problem?
- Evaluative criteria (academic)
	- Gives info on how to evaluate criteria (ex. study spaces should be no more than 90% full)
	- Key metrics, how those metrics are measured. Evaluate your data against these

## Grammar 2

Equal info should be communicated in the beginning (subject), middle (verb), and end (object) of a sentence.
- Scientific writing tends to "backload" sentences by demoting the subject

Wordiness errors
- Use of passive voice
- Use of an unnecessary subject
- Unnecessary repetitions
- Inflated phrases
- Generic helping verbs
	- Turn a noun into a verb to fix this (nominalization)
	- "would be in violation" -> "would violate"
- Noun strings: "workplace conflict management course"
	- Use parallel structure!
