#### An Exoskeleton That Boosts Biceps Wins James Dyson’s $45,000 Prize
- Entertaining images
- Pop culture references
	- "_Elysium_ proved that even doughy dudes like Matt Damon could be futuristic action heroes with the help of a high-tech exoskeleton"
- Chronologically structured (about the students' story)
	- "The students started thinking about the benefits"
- Very few statistics
- Typo
	- "The tea found"
- Published on WIRED, a general news outlet
**Audience - General public**

#### $The Future of Exoskeletons: Lighter Loads, Limbs and More 
- No images, a few ads
- Provides a more technical overview on the project
	- "The exoskeleton, powered by a 48-volt battery pack, uses an onboard computer, weighs 11.7 kilograms"
- References robotics journals
- More focus on industry progress as a whole rather than a specific "story"
- Professional tone - no jokes, just information
**Audience - Tech/science enthusiasts**

#### World’s first affordable powered exoskeleton is almost here: Prepare for mech wars 
- Images and ads
- Joke immediately in the title & throughout
	- "While the suit might let you out thumb a lobster"
- Non-technical vocab and phrasing
	- "The hexapodal Athlete is not an exoskeleton for a person; it is of a much larger scale, more of an exoskeleton for a car."
- A few stats/specifications
**Audience - General tech-interested public**

#### Design Requirements of Generic Hand Exoskeletons
- Filled with citations
- Broken up into sections, with a table of contents
- Published by IEEE
- Diagrams and graphs
- Much longer than the other articles
