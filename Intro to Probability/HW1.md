	**(a) If we select 2 marbles at random with replacement, what is the probability that they are of the same color?**   
	- $P(\text{2 same}) = P(\text{2 red}) + P(\text{2 green}) + P(\text{2 blue}) = (P(\text{red}))^{2} + (P(\text{green}))^{2} + (P(\text{blue}))^{2} = (\frac{4}{11})^{2} + (\frac{2}{11})^{2} + (\frac{5}{11})^{2} = \frac{16}{121}+ \frac{4}{121} + \frac{25}{121} = \frac{45}{121}$
	**(b) If we select 3 marbles at random without replacement, what is the probability that they are of the same color?**  
	- 
	**(c) Suppose we select 2 marbles at random with replacement. Define the events A = {At least one marble is red} and B = {Both marbles are green}. Are A and B independent? Prove your answer.**  
	- 
	**(d) Does your answer to (c) change if sampling without replacement? Explain.**

1. **A deck has 52 cards, 13 clubs, 13 spades, 13 hearts, and 13 diamonds. In each suit (clubs, spades, hearts, or diamonds), the cards are labelled 2, . . . , 10, J, Q, K, A. Suppose we draw a hand of four cards at random without replacement. What is the probability of:**  
	**(a) A hand with at least two A?**  
	- 
	**(b) A hand with three of a kind?**  
	- 
	**(c) A hand with two distinct pairs? Distinct means four of a kind is not counted.**  
	- 
	**(d) A hand with J, J, K, A and with no two cards of the same suit?**  
	- 
	**(e) A hand with cards in exactly three suits represented?**

1. **Suppose 5 students select seats at random in a classroom with 2 rows of 5 seats each. What  is the probability that no two students sit next to one another? That is, there is at least one empty seat between students in the same row.**  
	- 
3. **For two events A and B, is it possible that they are both independent and mutually exclusive? Does your answer depend on whether P (A) > 0 and P (B) > 0?**
