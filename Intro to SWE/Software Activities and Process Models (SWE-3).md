**Process**: A collection of activities, actions, and tasks used for product creation

All software systems include 4 fundamental software engineering activities
- Specification
	- Establishing what services are required, establishing constraints ![[Pasted image 20240117152135.png]]
- Design and Implementation
	- A description of the structure to be implemented, interfaces, algorithms, etc
	- The process of delivering software for delivery ![[Pasted image 20240117152447.png]]
- Validation
	- Showing a system confirms to specification and meets consumer expectations![[Pasted image 20240117152856.png]]
- Evolution
	- Maintain and enhance existing code ![[Pasted image 20240117153129.png]]

Software development life cycle
- Plan-driven: all process activities are organized in sequence
	- Waterfall: Development is broken into stages, which are done one at a time![[Pasted image 20240117154014.png]]
		- Benefits: Easy to use, identifies milestones
		- Disadvantages: Non-iterative, requires accurate requirements, difficult to "swim upstream"
- Incremental: Process activities are interleaved
	- Agile: Start with important stuff, incrementally introduce features ![[Pasted image 20240117154257.png]]
		- Advantages: Flexible, less documentation needed, usable earlier
		- Disadvantages: Bad for large-scale, long-lifetime systems
- Integration & Configuration: Process activities focus on availability and
reusable components
- Reuse model: ![[Pasted image 20240117154634.png]]
	- Use similar code that already exists
	- Easier
	- Not super practical or flexible
