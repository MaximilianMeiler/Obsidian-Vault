Overview
- Lexical Analysis
	- Performed by a Lexer or Scanner
	- Converts sequence of characters into sequences of tokens
	- Done w REGEX
- Parsing
	- Performed by a Parser
	- Recognizes legal phrases of tokens using the rules of a grammar (CFG)
	- Converts token sequences into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
	- Doesn't use REGEX
- Static Semantic Analysis
	- Type checking is completed
- Code Generation
	- May involve several phases depending how much optimization is included

- Syntax: the structure of a language
	- Lexical structure: legal tokens (words)
		- Defines how the character sequence is divided into a set of tokens
		- Formal notation ensures lexical rules are clear
		- We give names to specific regexs, and use those in other regexs as if they were symbols!
	- Phrase structure: how these tokens may be arranged
		- Ex. `if` - *expression in parentheses* - *block in braces*
	- Semantics: the meaning that may be found in the language

Recognizing tokens
- A **Deterministic Finite Automaton** is used to recognize the language generated by a given RE
- This is performed by a Lexer/Scanner
	- Also: removing comments, saving text & line locations, dealing with pragmas, etc
- Ad-hoc
	- Read characters one at a time
	- If you see a 1-char token, emit that token
	- Otherwise, continue reading...
- Finite State Automata
	- Check the Algo notes for info about these - they work the same!
